// XtoVp  obtain planar vector from small-angle transform.
// XtoVp(X) interprets X as the coordinate transform from A to B
// coordinates, and calculates the constant planar velocity of a third
// frame, C(t), that travels from A to B in one time unit.  Thus, C(0)=A,
// C(1)=B and dC/dt is a constant.  The return value is the planar velocity
// of C.  The calculation uses a small-angle approximation, and is therefore
// only exact if A and B are parallel.  The return value is an invariant of
// X (i.e., v=X*v), and can therefore be regarded as being expressed in
// either A or B coordinates.
