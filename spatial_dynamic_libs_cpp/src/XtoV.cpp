/// % XtoV  obtain spatial vector from small-angle transform.
/// XtoV(X) interprets X as the coordinate transform from A to B coordinates,
/// and calculates the constant spatial velocity of a third frame, C(t), that
/// travels from A to B in one time unit.  Thus, C(0)=A, C(1)=B, dC/dt is a
/// constant, and the return value is the spatial velocity of C.  The
/// calculation uses a small-angle approximation, and is therefore only exact
/// if A and B are parallel.  The return value, v, is an invariant of X
/// (i.e., v=X*v), and can therefore be regarded as being expressed in either
/// A or B coordinates.
