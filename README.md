# Dynamic algorithms for the humanoid HOAP-3

Code of my Master Thesis (can be found in docs and it is written in Spanish). 

I studied the [equation of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion) of a humanoid robot. It relates the torques that appear in the robots joints with their accelerations, taking into account the masses, inertias and kinematic model of the robot. 

I implemented several algorithms to obtain the forward and inverse dynamics using the Featherstone's approach of spatial algebra.
